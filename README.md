# Day3-Practice-RegistrartionApp

Created this Registration page to practice the concepts of components and Forms in Angular.<br></br>
# This Registration page has the following fields:<br></br>
      First Name;
      Last Name;
      Email;
      Phone Number;
      Gender;
      Password;
      Repeat Password;
<br></br>
# All these fields have Validators like: <br></br>
      *required*
      *minLength*
      *maxLength*
      *pattern*
<br></br>
The Submit button remains disabled until you enter the password.<br></br>
Once you enter the password the Submit button enables but dose not allow you to submit the form until you repeat the password in the 'Repeat Password' field correctly.
